# Microsoft-Malware-Classification-Challenge-BIG-2015

Problem Statement

In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest
heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware
groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. The
major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a
given piece of file/software is a malware.

Business objectives and constraints

1. Minimize multi-class error.
2. Multi-class probability estimates.
3. Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer. It should fininsh in
a few seconds or a minute.

Data Overview

For every malware, we have two files:
1. .asm file (read more: https://www.reviversoft.com/file-extensions/asm)
2. .bytes file (the raw data contains the hexadecimal representation of the file's binary content,
without the PE header)
Total train dataset consist of 200GB data out of which 50Gb of data is .bytes files and 150GB of
data is .asm files:
Lots of Data for a single-box/computer.
There are total 10,868 .bytes files and 10,868 asm files total 21,736 files.

There are 9 types of malwares (9 classes) in our give data.

Types of Malware:
1. Ramnit
2. Lollipop
3. Kelihos_ver3
4. Vundo
5. Simda
6. Tracur
7. Kelihos_ver1
8. Obfuscator.ACY
9. Gatak

Type of Machine Learning Problem

There are nine different classes of malware that we need to classify a given a data point => Multiclass classification problem
